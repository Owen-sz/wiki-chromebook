title: Early Upgrades for Ultramarine 41
description: "A temporary notice for the 40 to 41 upgrade path."

import Alert from "../../../../components/Docs/Alert.astro";

We're proud to announce that upgrades to Ultramarine Linux 41 (Cyberia) are ready right now in your edition's app store!

<Alert type="danger">
  In Ultramarine 40, the `dnf` command uses dnf5, which may break certain
  release upgrades. Upgrade graphically, or use `dnf4`.
</Alert>

<Alert type="info">
  Raspberry Pi users should wait to upgrade, we will have more information for
  you soon.
</Alert>

Ultramarine 41 comes with the usual desktop and under-the-hood changes for our existing users. In addition, Flagship and Xfce Edition are switching to Slick greeter from LightDM-GTK, this will happen automatically when you upgrade.

This release also comes with umcli, more information to come!

We know this seems lackluster, but a lot of our changes are for new installs and hardware enablement this time around, so stay tuned!

## Upgrading

Unlike previous releases, everything is now handled in your edition's app store. If you're on Flagship, GNOME, or Xfce, it's called Software. On Plasma, it's called Discover.

You may need to update your copy of Ultramarine 40 before the upgrade will become available.

## Command Line

In case the above doesn't work, you can always upgrade through the command line, using `dnf4 system-upgrade`.

Run the following and follow the prompts:

```sh
sudo dnf4 upgrade --refresh
sudo dnf4 install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade
sudo dnf4 system-upgrade download --releasever=41
sudo dnf4 system-upgrade reboot
```
