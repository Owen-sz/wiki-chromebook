Chromebooks were an obvious target for Ultramarine Everywhere, despite being mostly
standard hardware, they have custom EC and strange firmware. We began development
in Ultramarine 39, and are preparing to launch midcycle.

Chromebook support in Ultramarine Linux is provided in partnership with the [Chrultrabook Project](https://chrultrabook.com).

# x86

All x86 Chromebooks that use Depthcharge are supported by Ultramarine Chromebook Edition.

## Userland Changes

Devices in Ultramarine Everywhere try to stick very closely to the standard Ultramarine userland, sometimes we have to deviate from this to make the experience better.

### Audio Support

We use WeirdTreeThing's [audio script](https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing/chromebook-linux-audio) to make audio work properly.

### Chrultrabook Controller

We ship the [Chrultrabook Controller app](https://github.com/death7654/Chrultrabook-Tools) to provide some missing features, like fan and backlight control.

### Default Partitions

On Chromebooks, we use ext4 in lieu of Btrfs, and disable swap to extend the life of the EMMC found in many Chromebooks. We also create one 16MiB partition containing [Submarine](https://developer.fyralabs.com/submarine) at the start of the disk instead of `/boot/EFI` and `/boot`

### Keyboard Mapping

We use [keyd](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd) to map keys on Chromebooks.

## Installation

Prebuilt images with userland tweaks will be available in the near future

## Manual Installation - NOT RECOMMENDED

<Alert type="warning">
  This method is **NOT RECOMMENDED**. Only do this if you know what you're doing
  and need to test. We are not responsible for brickage, thermonuclear war, the
  death of a pet, etc.
</Alert>

This guide assumes you have [Developer Mode](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/main/developer_mode.md#dev-mode) and [USB Booting Enabled](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/main/developer_guide.md#boot-from-your-usb-disk)

1. Flash an [Ultramarine Raw Image](https://images.fyralabs.com/images/ultramarine/39/) to a USB Drive
2. Delete the first partition on the disk
3. Create a 16MB ext4 partition
4. Flash the submarine.kpart file to the partition
5. Set the partition flags with cgpt

```
cgpt add -i <partition number> -t kernel -P 15 -T 1 -S 1 /dev/sdX
```

6. Boot the image on the Chromebook

You're now inside a minimal Ultramarine system, from here you can install a desktop (also `NetworkManager-wifi`) and use Ultramarine from the external disk. If you'd like to install, you'll need to install and configure Anaconda. [Our Kickstarts can be found on Github.](https://github.com/Ultramarine-Linux/build-scripts/tree/main/kickstarts)

7. On the internal disk, create a 16MiB ext4 partition BEFORE the standard partitions
8. Install Ultramarine normally
9. After the installation is complete, flash the submarine.kpart file to the 16MiB partition you created
10. Set the partition flags with cgpt

```
cgpt add -i <partition number> -t kernel -P 15 -T 1 -S 1 /dev/sdX
```

11. Done!
