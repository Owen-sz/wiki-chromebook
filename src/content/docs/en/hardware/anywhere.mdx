One of the major focuses of the Ultramarine project is to bring Linux to as many people as possible.
A major part of this is supporting as many devices as possible, through our Ultramarine Anywhere program.
By contributing to Ultramarine Anywhere, you can help us bring Linux to more devices and more people.
