One of the major focuses of the Ultramarine project is to bring Linux to as many people as possible.
A major part of this is supporting as many devices as possible, through our Ultramarine Everywhere program.
By contributing to Ultramarine Everywhere, you can help us bring Linux to more devices and more people.
