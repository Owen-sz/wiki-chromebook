Ultramarine Linux has an active community of users, tinkerers, developers, and everyone in between.

Our community (like our code) is open to everyone. Here's some of the official spaces:

### Discord

The Ultramarine Discord is for everyone! We offer an open chat and support here!

The Fyra Labs Discord is for all of our projects. We have lively discussions and build great things together. This is where you should start if you'd like contribute code.

### Matrix

Fyra Labs is on Matrix! We're working to bridge more Ultramarine channels over but for now you can access the best of the Fyra Labs community inside Matrix!

All of our development channels are bridged, so you can also start here if you'd like to contribute code.

### Reddit

The Ultramarine Subreddit is a more asynchronous way to interact with the community. It offers the same great things in a more reddit-y way.

### Socials
Ultramarine Linux is on Twitter and the Fediverse. These accounts will include important updates about features, bugs, and downtime.

## Our Philosophy
We believe that the Fyra Community is larger than just Fyra (the organization). Part of this is interacting with the rest of our community. We feel that this allows us to better judge the desires and needs of our users (and we love talking to all of you.)
