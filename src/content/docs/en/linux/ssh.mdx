Secure Shell ("SSH") is one of the most common utilities when access to a remote device is needed. It's encrypted, powerful, and simple to understand.

## SSH overview
SSH uses a client/server model where one computer acts as an SSH server[^1] and allows other computers to connect.

## Connecting to an SSH Server
To access a device remotely, the `ssh` command is run from [the shell](/en/linux/shell), mostly used with this format:

```zsh
ssh [username@]<server url>
```
If you don't specify a username then SSH will attempt to connect you using the username with which you are logged in. Here are some examples:
- `ssh myuser@myserver.com`
    - This will attempt to connect to the server at myserver.com using the username myuser
- `ssh myuser@192.168.1.2`
    - This is just like the example above except you can also specify an IP address instead of a hostname
- `ssh myserver.com`
    - This will attempt to connect to the SSH server at myserver.com using your current username
- `ssh 192.168.1.2`
    - Same as above but using an IP address instead of a hostname

When using any of the above commands, once connected to the remote server you'll be prompted for a password.

[^1]### A Note about the Word "Server"
It's common to hear the word "server" used but not understand exactly what is meant. Here are a couple examples of how "server" can be used:

- It can refer to a physical machine somewhere
    - Ex: Our email server lost power over the weekend.
- It can refer to a specific *application* running on one machine (or even a number of machines across the world!)
    - Ex: The SSH server is up so that users can connect.

In this guide we'll try to make it clear to which we're referring.
