One of the most noticeable contributions you can make is code contributions. Wether it's building a new feature or fixing a bug, contributing code is a great way to make a noticeable difference to the operating system itself.

This page serves as a step-by-step guide to hacking on Ultramarine Linux components.

## Think of a Problem

This can be one you or someone you know faces with Ultramarine, or even just computing at large.

For example, Nvidia drivers, this is an issue with most Linux distributions that Ultramarine solves.

This problem can be anything from a tiny papercut to a massive structural change. There's no such thing as a bad idea.

## Gather Information

What's the cause? Do other people see this as a problem?

A great place to ask this question is the Ultramarine Discord, simply ask and see what people think.

## Decide How You're Going to Solve It

This is the best part, come up with a couple ideas on how to solve the problem.

## Build the Solution

### Getting the Ultramarine Toolchain

If you're contributing to an existing component, simply get the tools needed for it (we're slowly adding a list to our repositories.)

If you're building a completley new feature, there's a few more steps

Get to work! Make a fork of a project and tinker away!

**Big Changes**

For especially big changes, or major features, ask for help. We'll help you refine and build your idea.

## Testing 123

Test the solution on your machine, if it works move on, if it doesn't keep tinkering until it does.

## Getting into Ultramarine

After you've tested, it's time to contribute. Simply open a pull request and we'll review it. There's three possible outcomes
- Approval - We approve your solution, be proud as very few PRs get merged without changes.
- Request for Changes - Something needs to change! Fix a problem or two and you're golden!
- Denial - This doesn't happen very often, sometimes a feature just doesn't align with our plan. It's more likely that we'll simply ask you for changes.
