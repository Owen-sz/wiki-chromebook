description: "Getting started with contributing to Ultramarine Linux"
---
Ultramarine is built with our community. From polls and community engagement to community-built software, we involve our community in everything we do.

## Code
Ultramarine Linux is open source. Because of this, anyone can add to, copy, or distribute the code that makes up Ultramarine.

This applies to all of the code that Fyra Labs writes with the community, and most of the code from Fedora. 

Sadly, some components, like drivers are not open, meaning we cannot see or improve the code.
