description: "Getting started with contributing to Ultramarine Linux"
---
Ultramarine is built with our community. From polls and community engagement to community-built software, we involve our community in everything we do.

## Code
Ultramarine Linux is open source. Because of this, anyone can add to, copy, or distribute the code that makes up Ultramarine.

This applies to all of the code that Fyra Labs writes with the community, and most of the code from Fedora. 

Sadly, some components, like drivers are not open, meaning we cannot see or improve the code.

Check out the [Development Page](hacking) to get started!

## Bug Hunting
This part is easy, just use Ultramarine and report bugs as you find them. You can report general issues to [Ultramarine-Linux/ultramarine](https://github.com/Ultramarine-Linux/ultramarine), or ask in our chats where to report.


## Translations
Translations allow Ultramarine to be used by people around the world. You can lend us your expertise to get Ultramarine in your language.

### This Wiki
Reach out in [one of our chats](community) and we'll make you a branch.
