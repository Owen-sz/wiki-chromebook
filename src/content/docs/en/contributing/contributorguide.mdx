description: "Getting started with contributing to Ultramarine Linux"
---

Ultramarine is built with our community. From polls and community engagement to community-built software, we involve our community in everything we do.

## Code

Ultramarine Linux is open source. Because of this, anyone can add to, copy, or distribute the code that makes up Ultramarine.

This applies to all of the code that Fyra Labs writes with the community, and most of the code from Fedora.

Sadly, some components, especially device drivers, may be (in a way) held hostage by their authors. This means we cannot see or fix the code.

Check out the [Development Page](/en/contributing/hacking) to get started!

## Bug Hunting

This part is easy, just use Ultramarine and report bugs as you find them. You can report general issues to [Ultramarine-Linux/ultramarine](https://github.com/Ultramarine-Linux/ultramarine), or ask in our [one of our chats](/en/community/community) where to report.

## Design

New and existing Ultramarine specific components require user-friendly and visually appealing designs. If you would like to help out with design, join one of our [one of our chats](/en/community/community) and ask where you can help.

## Documentation

Documentation allows people to understand how to use Ultramarine. Our main source of documentation is the wiki you're currently reading. If you would like to contribute to the wiki, you can make a pull request to the [Ultramarine-Linux/wiki-new](https://github.com/Ultramarine-Linux/wiki-new) repository. If you need help or want to discuss changes, please join [one of our chats](/en/community/community).

## Testing

There's many parts of Ultramarine that need testing before release. Here's a list of our current pre-release programs:

- [ARM Chromebook Beta Program](/en/chromebook/armbeta)

We annouce new programs frequently, [join our chat](/en/community/community) or [follow us on socials](/en/community/community) to stay up to date.

## Finance

You can [sponsor us on Github](https://github.com/sponsors/FyraLabs)!

Your sponsorship helps us continue and dedicate more time to our work, allowing us to develop and ship technology that can make a difference for you (and many others.) Now, of course, don't forget there's also some sweet and useful benefits (with even more coming soon) in it for you :3

## Hardware

One of Ultramarine's major focuses is to support as much hardware platforms as possible.

## Translations

Translations allow Ultramarine to be used by people around the world. You can lend us your expertise to get Ultramarine in your language.

### This Wiki

Reach out in [one of our chats](/en/community/community) and we'll make you a branch.

### The Installer and other Ultramarine Components

Head to [Fyra Weblate](https://weblate.fyralabs.com) to get started translating.

### Desktops

Each desktop environment handles their own translations for the desktop itself and the included apps

#### Flagship Edition

The Budgie Desktop's translation software no longer exists as of time of writing.

To contribute translations to apps used in Budgie, check out the [GNOME Translation Project.](https://wiki.gnome.org/TranslationProject)

#### GNOME Edition

The [GNOME Translation Project](https://wiki.gnome.org/TranslationProject) allows you to translate the GNOME Desktop and Core Apps.

#### Pantheon Edition

Check out the [elementaryOS translation instructions](https://docs.elementary.io/contributor-guide/localization/translations) to get started!

#### KDE Plasma Edition

Visit the [KDE Localization website](https://l10n.kde.org/).

#### (Upcoming) XFCE Edition

You can start translating for our upcoming XFCE Edition right now! Head over to the [XFCE Translation website](https://docs.xfce.org/contribute/translate/start).

## Upstream Contributions

Ultramarine is built on top of many open source and libre software projects, with similar goals and contribution needs to Ultramarine. Our community regularly contribute to these upstream projects, and we encourage you to do the same.

Here are a list of important upstream projects to Ultramarine, with links to their contribution pages:

- [Fedora](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/join/)
- [Budgie](https://docs.buddiesofbudgie.org/organization/getting-involved/)
- [GNOME](https://welcome.gnome.org/)
- [Pantheon](https://docs.elementary.io/contributor-guide)
- [KDE](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved)
- [XFCE]
