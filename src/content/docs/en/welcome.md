Welcome to the Ultramarine Wiki! This wiki is designed to help users get settled into Ultramarine Linux.

Developer Documentation has moved to [Fyra Developer](https://developer.fyralabs.com).

On this page you can read about all the general project information, so if you want to become familiar with important concepts and our philosophy make sure to read this first!

## General philosophy

Ultramarine Linux is meant to be a spiritual successor to Korora Linux, with the goal of making an operating system that "just works". We are making the base Fedora experience a little more pleasant with tweaks, which improves the experience for new and advanced users equally.

Some of the things Ultramarine offers, for example; media codecs, may seem trivial to more advanced users, but to someone coming from Windows, or even just someone who hasn't used Fedora before this may take hours or be so difficult that they give up. Ultramarine serves to streamline this experience.

### Pragmatism

### Innovation

### User Experience

## Planned features

- Welcome app for user onboarding with quick access to common actions
- System configuration application similar to YaST
- Custom installer to improve user experience compared to Anaconda which has a possibly overwhelming interface for new users

## FAQ

### What does the migration script do?

The migration scripts install RPMFusion, Terra repository, our signing keys, then installs the bare minimum of an Ultramarine Linux installation on top of an existing Fedora installation (Swapping Fedora release packages with the Ultramarine ones).

The script only installs the bare minimum required for Ultramarine Linux to work because we don't want to add additional bloat to your current system.

### Why does this distro exist? What difference does it have other than just Fedora with RPMFusion?

Ultramarine Linux was created out of frustration with the legal limits of Fedora. As Fedora (and Red Hat) is an American entity, there are legal restrictions on what software can be
packaged in the distribution due to the US patent system.

Ultramarine, on the other hand is based in Thailand, and is not subject to any of the copyright restrictions on what software can be packaged.

The Ultramarine team aims to make Fedora a little more user friendly by allowing users to install or package any software they want as long as someone maintains it in either RPMFusion or the Ultramarine repository.

As the time of this writing, there are currently few Ultramarine packages available, but we are looking to add more software to the distribution.

Ultramarine highly encourages users to contribute to the project by submitting packages to the Ultramarine repository and maintaining them. We provide a Github bot that will automatically bump package versions and build them as new versions are released upstream, so you only have to worry about fixing packaging issues downstream.

### Is Ultramarine simply just Fedora with extra desktop environments?

No, Ultramarine is not just Fedora with extra desktop environments. We aim to ease the user experience by providing a more friendly first-time experience, and to make the system "just work" for new and advanced users.

### Does Ultramarine track or collect my data?

Fyra Labs (the company behind Ultramarine) does not collect data without express consent from the user.
