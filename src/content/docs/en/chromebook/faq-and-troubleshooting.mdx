## Troubleshooting

<Alert type="warning">
  If your issue still persists after reading this page, hop into [our
  chats](/en/community/community) and make a support forum post.
</Alert>

### Chromebook fails to boot to internal disk

Assuming you are selecting 'Boot to Internal Disk', or pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> does not fully boot (usually only to Submarine, the boot entries screen before Ultramarine boots), this usually means the device has died. Plug in your Chromebook.

### Keyboard is not properly mapped

Try re-installing the cros-keyboard-map package from Terra. Simply run ` sudo dnf install cros-keyboard-remap`. If this does not work, try running Weirdtreething's [keyd script](https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing/cros-keyboard-map).

### Chromebook audio doesn't work

This should not happen unless you have unsupported speakers, but if it does, try running Weirdtreething's [audio script](https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing/chromebook-linux-audio) manually.

You may have a speaker unsupported by the audio script by default (max98357a speakers). If you would like to enable audio on here, run the script manually and follow the prompts to enable audio.

<Alert type="warning">
  max98357a, and any other audio devices requiring ```--force-avs-install``` is
  not recommended to enable, and support will not be given to damaged speakers.
  If you really want to proceed, do not raise your speakers volume high or they
  will get damaged.

## FAQs

### Why doesn't [insert hardware feature] work?

All hardware should work on almost every supported Chromebook model, but some specific Chromebooks may have some missing features (ex. Drallion, Sarien, and Arcada have a Wilco (Dell Enterprise) EC, and may have missing features).

### Is this legal?

Yes, it is perfectly legal. Chromebooks and ChromeOS are backed by the [Chromeium Projects' ChromiumOS](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/}). All information on how to mod Chromebooks is on this site, and open to anyone to use.

### Why not just run [mrchromebox's Firmware Utility Script?](https://mrchromebox.tech/#fwscript)

The goal here is to be as easy and safe to use as possible. It is also easier to go back to ChromeOS if you keep the stock firmware. With that being said, we fully support the use of mrchromebox's script, it has many great use cases (This FAQ page is even being written on a UEFI ROM Chromebook).

### Will this make my Chromebook faster?

It usually can, as Ultramarine can be more lightweight then ChromeOS, but we do not guarantee a preformance gain vs ChromeOS.
If you are using an older/slower Chromebook and want to maximize performance, we reccomend using Xfce or Flagship edition.

### Should I buy a Chromebook vs a regular laptop now?

yes no maybe blah blah blah

### I thought Ultramarine used Btrfs?

Ultramarine proper does, but due to Btrfs's Copy-on-Write, checksumming, and other advanced features, it is very write intensive. Most Chromebooks have eMMC storage and lack an SSD controller (which enable fun things like wear-leveling algorithms and garbage collection) meaning they get worn out by Btrfs to quickly. We planned to use F2Fs, which is a good file system for all types of NAND, but we were unable to implement it in current systemd-repart. We plan on fixing this upstream in the near future and enabling it as a file system option. We now use EXT4 as the file system, which is a very common, good all-around Linux file system, it's even what ChromeOS uses.

### This installer looks different, what is it?

We are using our in-house installer [Readymade](https://github.com/FyraLabs/readymade). Readymade is using [systemd-repart](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd-repart.html) as the backend. We always intended to use our own installer on Ultramarine proper, but Chromebook Edition is the first image to use it due to the limitations of other installers when attempting to image a disk with Submarine. Chromebook edition uses an early version of Readymade with pretty basic features, but all you need to install to a Chromebook. More advanced features similar to an all-purpose installer will be added in the near future.
