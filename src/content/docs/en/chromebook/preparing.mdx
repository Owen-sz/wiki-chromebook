Before we insert the installer, we will need to do a few things with your ChromeOS device.

### Step one: Back up your data (optional)

The next step will wipe all local data from your device, If you have any files you wish to save or move to Ultramarine Chromebook, back up your data off the device, either to the cloud or locally. For a small number of files, we recommend backing up to Google Drive, or another cloud storage provider. For a larger number of files, we recommend backing up to an external storage medium, such as a USB flash drive or other external drive. 

If you choose to back up with Google Drive, you will be prompted to add your Google Drive to the Ultramarine Chromebook file explorer during setup to easily redownload your data. 

### Step two: Enable developer mode
