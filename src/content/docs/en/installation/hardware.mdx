# Notes on Specific Hardware

## NVIDIA Graphics

For computers with NVIDIA graphics cards, you have two choices for drivers.

### Modern NVIDIA Graphics

For computers with recent Nvidia GPUs, you may either use the built in Noveau driver, or install NVIDIA proprietary drivers (recommended). Proprietary drivers are automatically installed during installation if you are connected to the internet.

If drivers weren't installed, or you switched to a NVIDIA GPU, you can install drivers by opening the "Software" app and searching for "NVIDIA" or by running `sudo dnf install akmod-nvidia` in the terminal.

### Legacy NVIDIA Graphics

Older computers may have stability issues using the proprietary NVIDIA drivers, using the built-in driver is a-okay with these cards.

## Broadcom and Realtek Networking

Some computers with specific Broadcom or Realtek chipsets may require additional drivers to be installed. You may need to connect to the internet via Ethernet or USB tethering from your phone to install these drivers.
