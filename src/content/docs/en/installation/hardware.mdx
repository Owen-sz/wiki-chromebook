## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

These requirements are the **_bare minimum_** to run Ultramarine Linux. Using Ultramarine on a computer of this calliber will not be a good time.

- 1gb of RAM
- 64-bit processor (x86_64 **OR** aarch64)
- 8gb of disk space

### Recommended Requirements for Standard PCs

These are our suggestions for the most basic (daily-driveable) system:

- 4GB of RAM (8GB or more recommended)
- 64-bit processor (x86_64/amd64)
- 10GB of free disk space (20GB or more recommended)
- Internet connection (for downloading the ISO image, updates, and additional drivers)
- A computer that supports booting from a USB drive or DVD (most computers made after 2007 should support this feature)
- A DVD or USB drive (for creating the bootable media)

### Minimum Requirements for x86 Chromebooks

- A [supported device](wiki.ultramarine-linux.org/chromebook/supported-devices)
- USB Port **OR** SD Card Reader
- 8gb of disk space (Total space, not what is usable in ChromeOS)
- Ability to [enable developer mode](wiki.ultramarine-linux.org/chromebook/enabling-developer-mode)

### Minimum Requirements for Raspberry Pi

- Raspberry Pi 4 or newer
- 4GB of RAM **OR** 2GB of RAM without a desktop environment
- 8gb Class 10 MicroSD Card

### Minimum Requirements for ARM Devices Using UEFI

- 64-bit processor (aarch64)
- 4GB or RAM
- 10GB of Storage

## Information on Nonstandard Hardware

### Mac Computers with Apple Silicon

Asahi Linux support on Ultramarine Linux is currently in internal-only alpha. Ultramarine Linux will likely use the upstream versions of Asahi packages in the near future.

### ARM Chromebooks

A closed alpha for the Kukui family of ARM Chromebooks will be opening in the near future.

#### Devices in the Kukui Alpha Program

- Kakadu (ASUS Chromebook Detachable CM3 (CM3000))
- Krane (Lenovo Chromebook Duet/Lenovo IdeaPad Duet Chromebook First Generation)
- Kodama (Lenovo 10e Chromebook Tablet)

### NVIDIA Graphics

For computers with NVIDIA graphics cards, you have two choices for drivers.

#### Noveau Driver

[The Noveau driver](https://nouveau.freedesktop.org/) is a fully open source driver for NVIDIA graphics cards. It's built into Ultramarine so you can use your GPU instantly.

Despite how good this sounds, modern NVIDIA GPUs will suffer performance issues and screen tearing under the Noveau driver.

Older NVIDIA GPUs work well with the Noveau driver (and may only work with Noveau.)

#### Proprietary Driver

This is our recommended solution. Proprietary drivers support all of the features and performance of your GPU. They are automatically installed during installation if you are connected to the internet.

If drivers weren't installed, or you switched to a NVIDIA GPU, you can install drivers by opening the "Software" app and searching for "NVIDIA" or by running the following commands in terminal:

```bash
sudo dnf update # Update the system first, the drivers may not work right if you don't.
sudo dnf install akmod-nvidia # Install the NVIDIA kernel module.
```

<Alert type="warning">
  You MUST wait until the process is finished before rebooting. Rebooting too
  early might result in a broken installation! This may take upwards of 15
  minutes!
</Alert>

### Broadcom and Realtek Networking

Some computers with specific Broadcom or Realtek chipsets may require additional drivers to be installed. You may need to connect to the internet via Ethernet or USB tethering from your phone to install these drivers.

## BIOS Keys

These are the keys (or combonation of keys) used to enter the boot menu or BIOS settings on different computers.
