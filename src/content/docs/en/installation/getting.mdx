## System Requirements

If your computer could run Windows 7 well, chances are it'll run Ultramarine Linux. You should check the [Minimum Requirements](hardware) to make sure

## Choosing Your Edition

Ultramarine Linux comes in 4 variants:

- **Flagship Edition**: Our default and most popular variant. Choose Flagship if you'd like a familiar and stylish experience.
- **KDE Edition**: Our second most popular variant. Choose KDE if you'd like a simply customisable experience.
- **GNOME Edition**: Elegant and Modern. Choose GNOME if you'd like a simple, unique experience.
- **Pantheon Edition**: Thoughtful and Graceful. Choose Pantheon if you'd like a refined experience.

Check the [hardware page](hardware) to make sure your hardware is supported.

Ultramarine Linux is distributed with ISO files available for download from [our website](https://ultramarine-linux.org).

### Atomic
Ultramarine Linux also comes in Atomic versions. Ultramarine Atomic works similarly to Fedora Silverblue, CoreOS and other OSTree-based operating systems. This variant is made for users who want a stable, immutable system that is easy to recover from.
We see immutablility as the future of Linux systems. Ideally this will become the standard edition in the future.

These builds are currently in beta. If you are planning to test them, please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/5fdPuxTg5Q) or [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#hub:fyralabs.com) community first and let us know. We'll be happy to receive feedback and assist you.

### Kanopy
**Ultramarine Kanopy** is an upcoming variant of Ultramarine Linux, which is made for servers and cloud computing. It is currently in development and does not have a release date yet, but we plan to target Q2 '24
It will be based on Ultramarine OSTree and is designed as a simple and easy-to-use server operating system, with a focus on containerized applications with a simple, easy-to-use web interface as a competitor to TrueNAS SCALE, OpenMediaVault and other similar operating systems.

## Verifying the Safety of an Ultramarine ISO (Recommended)

Ultramarine ISO images have a matching `CHECKSUM` file that can be checked against the image itself.

They can be downloaded by clicking the `View Checksum` button on the [download page](https://ultramarine-linux.org/download/).

### Verifying the Checksum on Linux

You can use the following commands to check the integrity of the ISO image:

```bash
sha256sum -b /path/to/ultramarine.iso # Generate the checksum for the ISO image
cat /path/to/CHECKSUM # Check the checksum

# Now you can compare the checksum
```

### Verifying the Checksum on Windows

```powershell
CertUtil -hashfile PATH\TO\ULTRAMARINE.ISO SHA256
# Open the CHECKSUM file with Nodepad and compare the checksum
```

## Creating the Installer

### On Other Operating Systems (Windows, macOS, Other Linux Distributions)

Use [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to create a bootable media from the ISO image.

Simply select the ISO file, a USB device, and click flash.

### On Ultramarine Linux

You can use the Fedora Media Writer to create a bootable media from the ISO image.

## Booting the Installer

After flashing the image to your USB drive, you can boot to Ultramarine Linux by plugging in the drive and restarting your computer.

Before your computer boots to your current OS, please refer to your computer's documentation on which key to press to select a custom boot option.

<Alert type='info'>

Most computers have a special key that can be used to select a boot device, or to enter the setup screen. This varies from brand to brand. These keys may be <kbd>Esc</kbd>, one of the function keys, or even <kbd>Delete</kbd>. The BIOS will usually display a message on the screen briefly on startup. If you're not sure which key to press, look up the key for your computer manufacturer.

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

On Intel Macs, press power, then hold down the <kbd>Alt</kbd> or <kbd>Option</kbd> key until disk icons appear.

</Alert>

If you're currently using Windows 10 (or newer) head to the recovery section of settings and select "Advanced Restart". Once there, select "Use a Device".

## Footnotes

- The Anaconda installer is very complex and hard to work with, we are working on a new installer that is easier to use and more reliable.
- Since Fedora 37, Fedora's official support for the Pantheon desktop environment has been dropped due to compatibility issues and the Pantheon port is now maintained by the Ultramarine Linux team. This means that the Pantheon desktop environment is only available through Ultramarine Linux, or Fedora with Terra enabled.
- Ultramarine's Budgie edition provides a close to stock Budgie experience, with a custom theme. Unlike Fedora's Budgie Spin, which provides a completely custom layout and experience.
