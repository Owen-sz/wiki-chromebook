After installing Ultramarine Linux, There are a few things you should do to make the most out of your new system.

## Install NVIDIA Drivers

If you were connected to the internet during installation, NVIDIA drivers were already installed. Otherwise, you can install them with these commands

```bash
sudo dnf update # Update the system first, the drivers may not work right if you don't.
sudo dnf install akmod-nvidia # Install the NVIDIA kernel module.
```

Then, reboot your system.

<Alert type="warning">
  You MUST wait until the process is finished before rebooting. Rebooting too
  early might result in a broken installation! This may take upwards of 15
  minutes!

### Use NVIDIA Graphics Card as the primary card on Optimus Laptops

This change is is completely optional. You can skip this step if you don't
want to use your NVIDIA Graphics Card as the primary card, or you do not use a
dual-GPU laptop conntected to an external monitor. It may also cause issues
with some applications, such as Steam and Bottles.

Run the following commands to make your NVIDIA Graphics Card the primary Graphics Card:

```bash
sudo cp -p /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/nvidia.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/nvidia.conf
sudo sed -i '10i\        Option "PrimaryGPU" "yes"' /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/nvidia.conf # Add PrimaryGPU = yes to the 10th line of the file.
```

Then reboot your system.

## Install Codecs

Ultramarine Linux includes codecs for most of the media you'll come across. You shouldn't need to install any additional codecs.

## Set up backups

You may want to back up your files to an external volume, you can use [Pika Backup] or [Déjà Dup] to do so.

Instructions are available on the [Déjà Dup] and [Pika Backup] websites.

### Set up Snapper (Btrfs Snapshots)

Currently, RPM's architecture does not handle snapper properly. You might experience broken RPM transactions when doing rollbacks. This is a known issue and must be addressed upstream.
