Welcome to the Ultramarine Wiki! This wiki is designed to help users get settled into Ultramarine Linux.

Developer and Package Maintainer Documentation has moved to [Fyra Developer](https://developer.fyralabs.com).

On this page you can read about all the general project information, so if you want to become familiar with important concepts and our philosophy make sure to read this first!

## General Philosophy

Ultramarine Linux is a spiritual successor to Korora Linux, with the goal of making an operating system that "just works" for people of all levels of experience.

In order to do this, we stick to a set of values:

### Ultramarine is Pragmatic.

Where Fedora tries to adhere to ideology (thatâ€™s perfectly fine), by shipping an (almost) entirely free system, Ultramarine works off the model of least resistance. That means we try to make it easy for the user, even if that means we have to ship some proprietary drivers and codecs that Fedora wouldnâ€™t be comfy with out-of-box.

### Ultramarine is Innovative.

We believe that recent innovations in the Linux space serve to greatly improve the user and developer experience. Technologies like Flatpak and xdg-portals allow developers to provide great experiences to our users more consistently. Work done upstream improves the experience for our users, and work done in the Ultramarine ecosystem, like accent colours, and Chromebook support, improves the larger Linux ecosystem. It's a win-win.

### Ultramarine is User-friendly.

While it may seem trivial to more advanced users to tweak a few settings and install some packages from 3rd party repositories, it may take people who are new to Linux (or even just new to Ultramarine) hours to figure out what packages they need, and where to find them. Ultramarine allows users new and old to get up and running quickly.

## Planned Features

- Welcome app for user onboarding with quick access to common actions
- System configuration application similar to YaST
- Custom installer to improve user experience compared to Anaconda which has a possibly overwhelming interface for new users

## FAQ

### What does the migration script do?

The migration scripts install RPMFusion, Terra repository, our signing keys, then installs the bare minimum of an Ultramarine Linux installation on top of an existing Fedora installation (Swapping Fedora release packages with the Ultramarine ones).

The script only installs the bare minimum required for Ultramarine Linux to work because we don't want to add additional bloat to your current system. 

After you're migrated, you'll get the latest and greatest Ultramarine features as we build them!

### Why does this distro exist? What difference does it have other than just Fedora with RPMFusion?

Ultramarine Linux was created out of frustration with the legal limits of Fedora. As Fedora (and Red Hat) is an American entity, there are legal restrictions on what software can be
packaged in the distribution due to the US patent system.

Ultramarine, on the other hand is based in Thailand, and is not subject to any of the copyright restrictions on what software can be packaged.

The Ultramarine team aims to make Fedora a little more user friendly by allowing users to install or package any software they want as long as someone maintains it in Flathub, RPMFusion or Terra.

Ultramarine highly encourages users to contribute to the project by submitting packages to the [Terra repository](https://terra.fyralabs.com). We provide a Github bot that will automatically bump package versions and build them as new versions are released upstream, so you only have to worry about fixing packaging issues downstream.

### Is Ultramarine simply just Fedora with extra desktop environments?

No, Ultramarine is not just Fedora with extra desktop environments. We aim to ease the user experience by providing a more friendly first-time experience, and to make the system "just work" for new and advanced users.

### Does Ultramarine track or collect my data?

Ultramarine collects system logs, which may include information on what software you use and disks you utilize. This data contains no personally identifiable information and remains on your system for debugging and support reasons.

As of now, the only data we collect is a count of how many times a package has been downloaded from Terra or the Ultramarine repository using [DNF Counting](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/infra/sysadmin_guide/dnf-counting/). This information is not tied to you or your computer.

Fyra Labs (the company behind Ultramarine) does not collect any data that can be tied to an individual without express consent from the user.
