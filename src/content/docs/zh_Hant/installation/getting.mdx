## 系統要求

若果您的電腦能夠運行微軟的 Windows 7，它很大可能亦能運行 Ultramarine Linux。您可以檢查電腦是否符合[硬件要求](/zh_Hant/hardware/requirements)。

## 版本

Ultramarine Linux 有 4 個版本︰

- **Flagship**（即 Budgie）︰我們最受歡迎的版本，適合追求一個熟悉及酷的系統的使用者。
- **KDE**︰我們第二最受歡迎的版本，適合追求一個容易改製的體驗的使用者。
- **GNOME**︰優雅而新淨，適合追求一個簡單而獨特的體驗的使用者。
- **Xfce**︰輕便而容易改製，適合追求一個輕快的體驗的使用者。

您可以檢查[系統要求](/zh_Hant/hardware/requirements)以確認您的裝置是否被支持。

[我們的網站](https://ultramarine-linux.org)裏提供不同格式及不同版本的 Ultramarine Linux。

### Atomic

Ultramarine Linux also comes in Atomic versions. Ultramarine Atomic works similarly to Fedora Silverblue, CoreOS, and other OSTree-based operating systems. This variant is made for users who want a stable, immutable system that is easy to recover from.
We see immutability as the future of Linux systems. Ideally, this will become the standard edition in the future.

These builds are currently in beta. If you are planning to test them, please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/5fdPuxTg5Q) or [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#hub:fyralabs.com) community first and let us know. We'll be happy to receive feedback and assist you.

(The "Home" and "Base" images are copies of [tauOS](https://tauos.co) - These **ARE NOT READY FOR DAILY USE!!**)

### Raw Images and Raspberry Pi

Ultramarine is also availible as a raw (or preinstalled) image. These images come with a desktop preinstalled and are intended to be flashed directly to the drive your device will boot from (like an SSD or an SD card.)

These can be found in the [Raw Image](https://images.fyralabs.com/images/ultramarine/40/) sections of the download page.

{/* ### Chromebook Edition */}

{/* Ultramarine is available for most x86 ChromeOS devices. See the [Chromebook Edition section](/en/chromebook/chromebook) for more information. */}

{/* ### Kanopy */}

{/* **Ultramarine Kanopy** is an upcoming variant of Ultramarine Linux, which is made for servers and cloud computing. It is currently in development and does not have a release date yet, but we plan to target Qx '2x */}
{/* It will be based on Ultramarine OSTree and is designed as a simple and easy-to-use server operating system, with a focus on containerized applications with a simple, easy-to-use web interface as a competitor to TrueNAS SCALE, OpenMediaVault, and other similar operating systems. */}

## 確認映像安全性（建議）

每一個映像都各自有一個*核對和*（checksum），供下載後可作映像核對之用。

在[下載頁](https://ultramarine-linux.org/download/)按下`View checksum`後即可下載核對和。

### 在 Linux 和 MacOS 核對

以下的指令能夠檢查映像是否完整無誤：

```bash
sha256sum -b /path/to/ultramarine.iso
cat /path/to/checksum
```

### 在 Windows 核對

以 Powershell 執行下列指令：

```powershell
CertUtil -hashfile PATH\TO\ULTRAMARINE.ISO SHA256
```
再利用 Notepad 打開核對和的檔案進行比較。

## Creating the Installer

Grab a USB stick! Use a flasher program to create an installer from the image. [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) is an easy cross-platform choice.

You can also use [Fedora Media Writer](https://github.com/FedoraQt/MediaWriter), or the Disks application on Flagship, Xfce, and GNOME editions.

<Alert type="info">
  Rufus has been known to cause issues with Ultramarine images.
</Alert>

## Booting the Installer

After flashing the image to your installer, you can boot to Ultramarine Linux by plugging in the installer and restarting your computer.

Most computers have a special key that can be used to select a boot device, or to enter the setup screen. This varies from brand to brand, check the [BIOS Keys Page](/en/hardware/bioskeys) for how to enter the boot menu on your machine.

<Alert type="info">
  If you're currently using Windows 10 (or newer) head to the recovery section
  of settings and select "Advanced Restart". Once there, select "Use a Device".
</Alert>

<Alert type="info">
  If you're currently using Linux, you may be able to enter the BIOS by running
  `sudo systemctl reboot --firmware`

## Footnotes

- The Anaconda installer is very complex and hard to work with, we are working on a new installer that is easier to use and more reliable.
- Since Fedora 37 the Ultramarine team has maintained Pantheon, in Ultramarine 40 we will be dropping Pantheon due to major issues with the experience.
- Ultramarine's Budgie edition provides a close to stock Budgie experience, with a custom theme. Unlike Fedora's Budgie Spin, which provides a completely custom layout and experience.
